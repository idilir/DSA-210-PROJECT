Coffee Preference,Sales and Weather Analysis

**Title**: Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Coffee Sales  

## Motivation  
Coffee shops often experience fluctuating sales due to weather conditions. This project explores how **temperature** and **rainfall** influence daily coffee sales at a caf√©. The goal is to help small businesses optimize inventory and staffing based on weather forecasts.  

## Data Sources  
1. **Weather Data**  
   - **Source**: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/)  
   - **Variables**: Daily temperature (¬∞C), rainfall (mm), and date for New York City (Jan‚ÄìMar 2023).  
   - **Collection**: Downloaded directly from NOAA‚Äôs public database.  

2. **Coffee Sales Data**  
   - **Source**: [Kaggle Coffee Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales) (simulated data).  
   - **Variables**: Daily sales ($), number of customers, date,location ,coffee tea preference.  
   - **Enrichment**: Merged with weather data to analyze correlations.
  
     
##  Objectives  
- Analyze correlations between weather (temperature, rainfall) and coffee sales.  
- Identify patterns in coffee vs. tea preferences based on weather.  
- Assess location-specific sales trends and time-of-day purchasing habits.  
- Develop predictive insights for inventory and staffing optimization.

## Hypothesis   

### Temperature vs. Coffee Sales  
- **H‚ÇÄ**: Temperature has no effect on coffee preference/sales.  
- **H‚ÇÅ**: Temperature significantly affects coffee preference/sales.  

###  Rainfall vs. Coffee Sales  
- **H‚ÇÄ**: Rainfall has no effect on coffee preference.  
- **H‚ÇÅ**: Rainfall significantly affects coffee preference.  

### Temperature-Rainfall Interaction  
- **H‚ÇÄ**: No interaction effect between temperature and rainfall.  
- **H‚ÇÅ**: Significant interaction effect exists.  

### Location-Based Preferences  
- **H‚ÇÄ**: No variation in coffee preference by location.  
- **H‚ÇÅ**: Coffee preference varies significantly by location.  

### Quinary Hypothesis**: Time-of-Day Influence  
- **H‚ÇÄ**: Time of day has no impact on sales/preference.  
- **H‚ÇÅ**: Time of day significantly influences sales/preference.  


## üìä Expected Insights  
1. Correlation between colder temperatures and higher coffee sales.  
2. Impact of rainy days on beverage preferences.  
3. Interaction effects of weather on peak sales periods.  
4. Location-specific trends (e.g., business vs. residential areas).  
5. Time-of-day sales patterns (morning coffee vs. evening tea).
