## Coffee Preference, Sales, and Weather Analysis

**Title**: Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Coffee Sales

---

## üß≠ Motivation
Coffee shops often experience fluctuating sales due to weather conditions. This project explores how **temperature** and **rainfall** influence daily coffee sales at a caf√©. The goal is to help small businesses optimize inventory and staffing based on weather forecasts.

---

## üìä Data Sources
1. **Weather Data**
   - **Source**: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/
   - **Variables**: Daily temperature (¬∞C), rainfall (mm), and date for New York City (Jan‚ÄìMar 2023).

2. **Coffee Sales Data**
   - **Source**: [Kaggle Coffee Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales)
   - **Variables**: Daily sales ($), number of customers, date, location, coffee/tea preference.
   - **Enrichment**: Merged with weather data to analyze correlations.

---

## üß™ Data Enrichment  
To understand the impact of environmental conditions on beverage sales, both datasets were **merged** based on the `date` field. Additional engineered features were created for deeper analysis:

- `avg_temp_c`: Daily average temperature (from weather data)  
- `rain_mm`: Daily total rainfall  
- `hour`: Extracted from transaction timestamps to analyze time-of-day effects  
- `day_of_week`, `month`: Temporal features derived from date  
- `transaction_qty`: Total number of items purchased per transaction  
- `unit_price`: Derived by dividing sales amount by quantity  
- `is_rainy`: Boolean feature indicating whether rainfall occurred  
- `beverage_type`: Binary label for machine learning (1 = Coffee, 0 = Tea)

This enrichment enabled correlation analysis, feature selection, and predictive modeling.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze correlations between weather (temperature, rainfall) and coffee sales.
- Identify patterns in coffee vs. tea preferences based on weather.
- Assess location-specific sales trends and time-of-day purchasing habits.
- Develop predictive insights for inventory and staffing optimization.

![Unknown-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6cc531f-aa05-4200-96db-9ce62c144a1a)

**Insight**: Sales negatively correlate with temperature (-0.56), suggesting more sales in colder weather.

### 8. Coffee Sales vs Temperature (Detailed)
![Unknown-5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd2fa29-d277-4bc2-be7b-05a3127ef993)

**Insight**: Strong cluster of lower temperatures with diverse price ranges‚Äîsupports colder=more demand.

### 9. Tea Sales on Rainy vs Dry Days
![Unknown-15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14015bcf-99e3-4aad-b24f-849f49b1e364)

### 10. Product Category vs Temperature
![Unknown](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc81a652-6958-4747-9dc9-33a6957d3206)

**Insight**: "Cool" and "Cold" dominate coffee, tea, and bakery sales. Warm weather leads to drop.

### 11. Unit Price on Rainy vs Dry Days
![Unknown-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2740cc21-5ae9-4860-9e21-e3c4c68c1a06)

**Insight**: Rain has minimal effect on overall pricing.

### 12. Coffee vs Tea Preference by Rain
![Unknown-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca8838c4-1700-401e-91f8-3d1b53ddfa67)

**Insight**: Both coffee and tea see higher sales on rainy days‚Äîpossibly due to comfort-seeking.

### 15. Rainfall Effect by Product Category
![Unknown-6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45cf3706-1956-4503-aa29-7dbea570fd28)

## üìå Conclusion

This project analyzed how weather (temperature and rainfall) and time of day affect beverage sales. Key insights include:

- Cold mornings increase coffee sales  
- Tea consumption slightly rises on rainy afternoons  
- Time of day is a stronger predictor than weather  
- Weather does influence demand but not pricing significantly  
- Regression models struggle to predict unit price from weather  
- Classification models perform moderately well with class imbalance

**Business Implications**:
- Adjust inventory and staff for busy morning shifts  
- Use weather forecasts for minor demand shifts  
- For precise forecasting, integrate customer behavior and marketing data
